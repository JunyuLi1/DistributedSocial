Features of programs:
I develop a module that enables a program to send and receive direct messages to another user on the DSP platform. 
I will then incorporate this module into a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter that should allow any student to communicate with any other student in this class as long as they know each other usernames.

How to use:
Run a5.py and then you can see the GUI and see the instruction.
